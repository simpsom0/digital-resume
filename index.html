              <p>
                Centering around Stable Diffusion and AI art as a whole, I was
                able to explore it's potential for image & video generation.
                As it stands today, the use of AI's in creating art is highly
                controversial. This class wasn't framed as an endorsement, nor
                was it used to make a statement, more of an interest in
                technology that I was given the opportunity to pursue.

                This piece is a still from a long form video titled
                overthinking. I was new to the idea of creative coding at the
                time, and greatly enjoyed being able to pursue this interest
                within a class.

                This was a class I took during my 2nd to last semester Senior
                year. It was intended to be taken as an introduction to
                processing, and coding as a whole. Although I already knew the
                basics, this class helped me refine what I knew, as well as
                showed a potential way forward.

                This class opened the door to learning many different tools I
                hadn't had the time to try before. Photoshop, Illustrator, and
                After Effects are tools that are integral to anyone interested
                in Digital Art, and I'm fortunate to have learned them within
                a classroom setting.
